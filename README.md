# Hi, I'm Tom

I'm looking forward to getting to know you! This document is not intended to replace or override the relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. Its intention is to give you an idea of how I think and how I work.

## My role as a manager

TL;DR: I am here to make sure you are successful, happy, and working on the things that are most important to help our customers, improve our product, and improve our business. More granularly:

1.  I am here to make sure you are both successful and happy: I want you to improve your technical skills, grow your career, enjoy your work, and believe in both our team's and our company's mission.
2.  I am here to make sure our team is successful and pointed in the right direction. I am here to make sure our team is all aligned and pushing in the same direction
3.  I am here to make sure our team is getting what we need from other teams, and that other teams are getting what they need from us; I'm also here to help make sure we are working on the right things, which is not necessarily everything we're asked to do.
4.  I (try to) write some code too!

These are in approximate order of importance. If you are not successful and happy, our team is not successful (or happy). If our team is struggling, writing code will most likely not be my top priority.

Additionally: My job is _not_ to tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. It is also not to be the "official decision maker" for our team. As someone else once said "I am _accountable_ for the decisions the team make, even if I‚Äôm not the one making them most of the time."

I might have thoughts on your code, and I expect you to have thoughts on mine. In the end, you own your code and if you have a good reason for doing something, you should do it. You were hired here, which means you **are** a good software developer. While I might give feedback and coaching, I will never discredit your work.

## Feedback

If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that doesn't fit in any of these categories. Even if you think it might not be the case, I _do_ want to hear it. And if you think I don't want to hear it, I'd love to hear why you feel that way.

If you can give me this feedback in-person, I'd prefer that. If you're only comfortable kicking off a discussion with an email or a Slack message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all.

If you're not comfortable giving me this feedback yourself, I'd love for you to give it to someone above me in the management chain so they can anonymously relay it to me, and I can work on it.

Similarly, if you have feedback for a team member, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, please feel free to relay it to me to pass along.

If you want to give direct feedback but aren't sure how or aren't comfortable doing so, let me know and we can talk through it.

## One-on-ones

I will put thirty minutes on your calendar every other week for a one-on-one. If you need either more time or more frequent one-on-ones, let me know and I will adjust. I enjoy getting out of the office, so generally once a month or so, I may suggest that we go out for a coffee or a walk for our one-on-one. If we ever get a beverage or a snack, I or the company will foot the bill. I will probably schedule our first one-on-one for an hour just to be sure we have time to go over the team mission and other introductory things; don't feel the need to prepare for it.

One-on-ones are _your time_. I will probably have some things to discuss with you, but this is first and foremost your opportunity to let me know how you're doing, what you need, what you wish could be different, how you feel about our team and your teammates, what your career goals are... etc. These are for the conversations you might not necessarily have with me when we're sitting at our desks amongst coworkers. If you'd like to give me a brief status update on things you're working on or that you're stuck on, that is fine with me, but those are generally better-suited to a quick chat while I'm at my desk, an @ on a Github issue, a Slack message, or a separate meeting.

I encourage you to write down some things throughout the week that you want to chat about if you think that will help; it can be hard to think of or bring up things in the moment. If you have things you want to talk about but struggle with bringing them up, feel free to send me a vague agenda ahead of time. If you don't know what to talk about, say so. We can use that as a topic.

I take notes during our one-on-ones, either on my phone, my laptop, or in my head. You should expect to get a summary by e-mail soon after our one-on-one. Please let me know if there are any errors or omissions. I do this, so that: (a) I can ensure that I heard you correctly and (b) so that we can refer back to them later.

These are some interesting articles I've read about one-on-ones, though I don't necessarily agree with all of the points: [1](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/effective-1-on-1-meetings/), [2](https://medium.com/@mrabkin/the-art-of-the-awkward-1-1-f4e1dcbd1c5c). If you have thoughts on either, that might make a good topic to include in a one-on-one.

### Performance

I will give you feedback on how you're doing in our one-on-ones. If I'm worried about your performance, I will let you know. If you worry that I'm worried about your performance, please let me know.

I will draft for you two performance reviews per year. These are meant to capture a 360 degree picture of what you're doing well and where you have room to grow. We will talk more about the methodology and format of these performance reviews before the first one is conducted.

## My schedule

You can expect me in the office between 9am and 5pm. I am often in earlier or later than that, but with some exceptions these tend to be the hours you can count on finding me. I tend not to schedule meeting before 9:30am in case I'm running late.

I may occasionally work from home and will mark this in my Slack status üè°. 

I prefer to do one-on-ones in person if possible, so if you need to work from home on a day we're scheduled for a one-on-one and rescheduling is an option, please let me know so I can reschedule it, or reschedule it yourself during an open slot in my calendar.

### After-hours communication

I will get a sense of your normal working hours as we begin working together, and I will make a strong effort not to message you outside of these hours because I know many people have Slack notifications sent to their phone. I will sometimes send emails outside of your working hours, as emails don't tend to notify people quite as intrusively. You should not feel obligated to read or respond to any emails or messages you receive from me outside of your normal hours. If you are receiving after-hours messages from me with any frequency, please let me know‚Äîit may mean I'm misunderstanding the hours you normally work.

If for any reason I do urgently need you outside of your normal working hours, I will Slack you and specify that it's urgent. This will happen _extremely_ rarely (if ever).

Similarly, if you email or Slack me outside of my working hours, I may not respond quickly. I do try to keep up with notifications in case there's anything urgent, but if I read a message and it's non-urgent, I may leave it until the next working day. If you have something non-urgent you want to tell me and it's outside of my work hours, I don't mind if you Slack me, though I always appreciate an explicit note that it's non-urgent. If you need me urgently outside of work hours, send me a Slack message and let me know it's urgent.

## If you need something

1.  Snag me at my desk. If I have headphones on, it does _not_ mean I am "in the zone" and expect not to be interrupted. I'm probably just enjoying some music. Feel free to grab my attention, preferably by waving in my periphery or tapping my desk. If I'm about to have to run off for a meeting or somesuch, I'll let you know and figure out a better time to chat.
2.  Slack me or email me. Even if you want an in-person meeting, just message me to let me know you want to talk and I'll make time. If you would rather talk about something over email or message, that's fine too.
3.  Throw something on my calendar. If I am scheduled for an interview or something else I can't reschedule and you invite me to a meeting, I may chat with you and reschedule.

If I'm working from home, you can expect me to be as available as I would be if I was in the office. Although it may feel weird to schedule a brief remote meeting when you'd normally just swing by my desk for five minutes, please do so without hesitation if you think chatting face-to-face or screen-sharing will be more useful than textual communication.

## Caveat

Take this document with a grain of salt as it's a work in progress. I have never experienced having me as a manager. If I'm your manager and something here seems off, open a pull request or issue, or (probably more comfortably) bring it up to me in one-on-one or over Slack.

## Expectations of you

This document is meant to focus on how I work and what to expect from me. We will discuss expectations I have of you and the rest of the team soon after we begin working together, and I will link you to an internal onboarding document with some company-specific onboarding information.

## My interests
Here are some things I love. If you ever want to strike up casual conversation and don't know what to talk about, these are good bets :smiley:

* Animals. I used to foster cats and kittens, and you'll inevitably hear about my partner's and my cats, Celeste and Apollo. I like other animals too, so please tell me about your pets.

![Max and Ruth](/celeste_and_apollo.jpg)

* Coding silly webpages. I have a habit of throwing together webpages that are just for fun. Some examples are [ü¶Ü.to](http://ü¶Ü.to) and [shadyjakes.biz](http://shadyjakes.biz). My personal (infrequently updates) website is [motevets.com](http://motevets.com).

* [Hexaflexagons](http://vihart.com/hexaflexagons/). These mathematical origami/fidget toys have been captivating me for the last six years. I even made a [webapp to make custom designed hexaflexagons](http://motevets.com/projects/2017/05/25/hexaflexago-hexaflexagon-generator.html).
